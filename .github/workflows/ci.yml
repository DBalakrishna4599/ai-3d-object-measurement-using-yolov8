# This section defines the trigger for the workflow.
# It will run on every push to the 'main' branch and on every pull request.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# This section defines the jobs to be run.
jobs:
  # We'll define a single job called 'build'
  build:
    # The type of virtual machine to run the job on. 'ubuntu-latest' is standard and free.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The sequence of steps that make up the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code so the workflow can access it

      # Step 2: Set up a Python environment

      # Step 4: Run the linter to check for code quality
